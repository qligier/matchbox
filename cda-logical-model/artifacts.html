               <td>
<p>A derivative of the RIM Act class, to be used when the other more specific classes aren’t appropriate.
Act.negationInd, when set to “true”, is a positive assertion that the Act as a whole is negated. Some properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, and the participations are not affected. These properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative Act. An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated “finding of wheezing on July 1” means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation.</p>

<p>Represents a participant who has attested to the accuracy of the document, but who does not have privileges to legally authenticate the document. An example would be a resident physician who sees a patient and dictates a note, then later signs it. A clinical document can have zero to many authenticators. While electronic signatures are not captured in a CDA document, both authentication and legal authentication require that a document has been signed manually or electronically by the responsible individual. An authenticator has a required authenticator.time indicating the time of authentication, and a required authenticator.signatureCode, indicating that a signature has been obtained and is on file.</p>

The role of the author can also be recorded in the Author.functionCode or AssignedAuthor.code attribute.

In some cases, the setting of the encounter is inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, such as where ClinicalDocument.code is “Diabetes Clinic Progress Note”. The setting of an encounter can also be transmitted in the HealthCareFacility.code attribute. If HealthCareFacility.code is sent, it should be equivalent to or further specialize the value inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code (such as where the ClinicalDocument.code is simply “Clinic Progress Note” and the value of HealthCareFacility.code is “cardiology clinic”), and shall not conflict with the value inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, as such a conflict would constitute an ambiguous situation.
EncompassingEncounter.dischargeDispositionCode can be used to depict the disposition of the patient at the time of hospital discharge (e.g., discharged to home, expired, against medical advice, etc.).</p>

<p>The language communication capabilities of an Entity.
While it may seem on the surface that this class would be restricted in usage to only the LivingSubject subtypes, Devices also have the ability to communicate, such as automated telephony devices that transmit patient information to live operators on a triage line or provide automated laboratory results to clinicians.
A patient who originally came from Mexico may have fluent language capabilities to speak, read and write in Spanish, and rudimentary capabilities in English. A person from Russia may have the capability to communicate equally well in spoken language in Russian, Armenian or Ukrainian, and a preference to speak in Armenian.</p>

<p>Represents a participant who has legally authenticated the document. The CDA is a standard that specifies the structure of exchanged clinical documents. In the case where a local document is transformed into a CDA document for exchange, authentication occurs on the local document, and that fact is reflected in the exchanged CDA document. A CDA document can reflect the unauthenticated, authenticated, or legally authenticated state. The unauthenticated state exists when no authentication information has been recorded (i.e., it is the absence of being either authenticated or legally authenticated). While electronic signatures are not captured in a CDA document, both authentication and legal authentication require that a document has been signed manually or electronically by the responsible individual. A legalAuthenticator has a required legalAuthenticator.time indicating the time of authentication, and a required legalAuthenticator.signatureCode, indicating that a signature has been obtained and is on file.</p>

Materials are entities that are neither Living Subjects nor places. Manufactured or processed products are considered material, even if they originate as living matter. Materials come in a wide variety of physical forms and can pass through different states (ie. Gas, liquid, solid) while still retaining their physical composition and material characteristics.
Clarify the meaning of “locationally independent”; suggest removing it and supplanting with first Usage Note sentence.

<p>A derivative of the RIM Observation class, used for representing coded and other observations.
Observation.negationInd, when set to “true”, is a positive assertion that the Observation as a whole is negated. Some properties such as Observation.id, Observation.moodCode, and the participations are not negated. These properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative Observation. An observation statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Observation. For instance, a negated “finding of wheezing on July 1” means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation.</p>

<p>A derivative of the RIM Observation class that represents multimedia that is logically part of the current document. This class is only for multimedia that is logically part of the attested content of the document. Rendering a referenced ObservationMedia requires a software tool that recognizes the particular MIME media type.
An XML attribute “ID” of type XML ID, is added to ObservationMedia within the CDA Schema. This attribute serves as the target of a renderMultiMedia reference (see renderMultiMedia). All values of attributes of type XML ID must be unique within the document (per the W3C XML specification).
The distinction between ObservationMedia and ExternalObservation is that ObservationMedia entries are part of the attested content of the document whereas ExternalObservations are not. For instance, when a clinician draws a picture as part of a progress note, that picture is represented as a CDA ObservationMedia. If that clinician is also describing a finding seen on a chest-x-ray, the referenced chest-x-ray is represented as a CDA ExternalObservation.</p>

<p>A derivative of the RIM SubstanceAdministration class, used for representing medication-related events such as medication history or planned medication administration orders.
SubstanceAdministration.negationInd, when set to “true”, is a positive assertion that the SubstanceAdministration as a whole is negated. Some properties such as SubstanceAdministration.id, SubstanceAdministration.moodCode, and the participations are not affected. These properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains the author of the negative SubstanceAdministration. A substance administration statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the SubstanceAdministration. For instance, a negated “aspirin administration” means that the author positively denies that aspirin is being administered, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation.
SubstanceAdministration.priorityCode categorizes the priority of a substance administration. SubstanceAdministration.doseQuantity indicates how much medication is given per dose. SubstanceAdministration.rateQuantity can be used to indicate the rate at which the dose is to be administered (e.g., the flow rate for intravenous infusions). SubstanceAdministration.maxDoseQuantity is used to capture the maximum dose of the medication that can be given over a stated time interval (e.g., maximum daily dose of morphine, maximum lifetime dose of doxorubicin). SubstanceAdministration.effectiveTime is used to describe the timing of administration. It is modeled using the GTS data type to accommodate various dosing scenarios.
The capture of medication-related information also involves the interrelationship of SubstanceAdministration with several other classes. The consumable participation is used to bring in the LabeledDrug or Material entity that describes the administered substance. The LabeledDrug class, which is an Entity class playing the Role of Manufactured Product, identifies the drug that is consumed in the substance administration. The medication is identified by means of the LabeledDrug.code or the LabeledDrug.name. The Material entity is used to identify non-drug administered substances such as vaccines and blood products.</p>

<p>A derivative of the RIM Supply class, used for representing the provision of a material by one entity to another.
The dispensed product is associated with the Supply act via a product participant, which connects to the same ManufacturedProduct role used for SubstanceAdministration.
The Supply class represents dispensing, whereas the SubstanceAdministration class represents administration. Prescriptions are complex activities that involve both an administration request to the patient (e.g. take digoxin 0.125mg by mouth once per day) and a supply request to the pharmacy (e.g. dispense 30 tablets, with 5 refills). This should be represented in CDA by a SubstanceAdministration entry that has a component Supply entry. The nested Supply entry can have Supply.independentInd set to “false” to signal that the Supply cannot stand alone, without it’s containing SubstanceAdministration. The following example illustrates a prescription representation in CDA.</p>
