","Base for all types and resources","Note: because this type is defined as an extension of SXCM_T, all of the attributes and elements accepted for T are also accepted by this definition. However, they are NOT allowed by the normative description of this type. Unfortunately, we cannot write a general purpose schematron contraints to provide that extra validation, thus applications must be aware that instance (fragments) that pass validation with this might might still not be legal.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Base",0,*,"","","n/a"
