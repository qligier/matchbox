An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated \"finding of wheezing on July 1\" means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation."
